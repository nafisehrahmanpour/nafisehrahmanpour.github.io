I am Nafiseh, a third year PhD student in computer science at USC. I study geometric generative AI, which employs geometric techniques to generate shapes, pictures or pattern. 
My background is in theoretical physics, where I enjoyed working on new mathematical models for gravity. I became interested in the potential for geometry/physics and computer science/AI to help each other. My research focuses on diffusion models.
