I am Nafiseh, a PhD student in Computer Science at USC, specializing in geometric generative AI. My research utilizes geometric techniques to generate shapes, images, and patterns. I hold a PhD in Physics, where I focused on developing new gravity models. I have always been interested in how different areas of science connect, which led me to explore the relationship between physics and computer science/AI. Among my research interests are diffusion models, which exemplify this interdisciplinary approach.
