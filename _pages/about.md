I am a PhD student in Computer Science at USC, studying geometric generative AI, i.e., using geometric techniques to generate shapes, images, and patterns. 
I hold a PhD in Physics, where I focused on the generalization of Einstein's gravitational field equations. I have always been interested in how different areas of science connect, which led me to explore the relationship between physics and computer science/AI. 

Among my current research interests are diffusion models, and their connection to geometry/physics, including
