I am Nafiseh, a third year PhD student in computer science at USC. I study geometric generative AI, which employs geometric techniques to generate shapes, pictures or pattern. My background is in mathematical physics, where I worked as PhD student in theoretical physics on metric measure space to
construct a conformally invariant theory of gravitation. I became interested in the potential for geometry/physics to help in computer science/AI. My research now focuses on diffusion models.
