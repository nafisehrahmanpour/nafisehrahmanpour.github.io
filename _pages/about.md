I am Nafiseh, a third year PhD student in computer science at USC. My research is focused on geometric generative AI, which utilizes geometric techniques to generate shapes, pictures and patterns. 
I have a background in mathematical and theoretical physics, where I enjoyed developing new models for gravity. I became interested in the interplay of geometry/physics and computer science/AI. Diffusion models is one of my research interests.
